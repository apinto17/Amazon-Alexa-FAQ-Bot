                              <p>In some departments, faculty advisors/mentors are assigned randomly to students at the time of entrance into Cal Poly. If you meet with your mentor and find that your interests are not the same, <strong>you can change your faculty advisor </strong>by asking a professor of your choice to be your advisor. Please make sure to inform your department of this change. </p>

A list of all minors can be found in the <a href="http://catalog.calpoly.edu/programsaz/#minors">Cal Poly catalog</a>. University Advising also maintains <a href="https://advising.calpoly.edu/minor-degree-advising">a list of minors that includes declaration information</a>.</p>

We do offer a full range of support services and resources for students interested in the health professions. These include: pre-health professions advising (both peer and professional), career profiles with course prerequisites required for health profession programs, a health professions newsletter, various health profession-oriented clubs, mock interviews, assistance with the application process and critique of personal statements.</p>

                           <p>In some departments, faculty advisors/mentors are assigned randomly to students at the time of entrance into Cal Poly. If you meet with your mentor and find that your interests are not the same, <strong>you can change your faculty advisor </strong>by asking a professor of your choice to be your advisor. Please make sure to inform your department of this change. </p>

                           <p>To declare, make sure the concentration is available for the catalog you are following. <a href="https://adobesign.calpoly.edu/PowerForm/3AAABLblqZhA2q2aQ9t1pO8bbB1WU2-diesfHV9lMp1rMznHfznsc7QEa_vHxi3rHXCLvZMFSundnLntM1f17qOEonU1998d6/">Then, submit this form to the Office of the Registrar.</a></p>

                           <p>The minor declaration process depends on the minor you are declaring. Some minors (e.g., BIO minor) may have major exclusions and/or GPA requirements. A list of all minors can be found in the <a href="http://catalog.calpoly.edu/programsaz/#minors">Cal Poly catalog</a>. University Advising also maintains <a href="https://advising.calpoly.edu/minor-degree-advising">a list of minors that includes declaration information</a>.</p>

                        <p>To declare, make sure the concentration is available for the catalog you are following. <a href="https://adobesign.calpoly.edu/PowerForm/3AAABLblqZhA2q2aQ9t1pO8bbB1WU2-diesfHV9lMp1rMznHfznsc7QEa_vHxi3rHXCLvZMFSundnLntM1f17qOEonU1998d6/">Then, submit this form to the Office of the Registrar.</a></p>
                        Please note that <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/evaluations-form-and-transcript-processing-timeline">it will take some time</a> for your concentration to be applied to your degree progress.

                        <p>The minor declaration process depends on the minor you are declaring. Some minors (e.g., BIO minor) may have major exclusions and/or GPA requirements. A list of all minors can be found in the <a href="http://catalog.calpoly.edu/programsaz/#minors">Cal Poly catalog</a>. University Advising also maintains <a href="https://advising.calpoly.edu/minor-degree-advising">a list of minors that includes declaration information</a>.</p>

         <p>A "D-" is the minimum passing grade in order to earn units for a class. However, this does not always mean that a D- grade will satisfy a given requirement. A good example of this is the Calculus series (MATH 141-143 in the 17-19 Catalog):</p>
